<h1>Airport Report</h1>

This is a program that permits first to show all the data in parsed csv files.
A user can then choose in a menu between two options: 

- Query (#1) -> Choose a country to display airports and runaways associated to each of its airport
- Reports ((#2) -> the user will choose in a menu either to display the 10 countries with highest number of airports and lowest number of airports or the type of runways per country or also the top 10 most common runway identifications.
